      Combine a series of .gitignores into one mega file. Perfect for those of
      us who want to use multiple gitignores in one project.

      Why do we even care about <code>.gitignore</code> files?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes (most of the time?) you don&#39;t want to commit every single
      file in your directory. Common files to exclude include build artifacts
      and log files. These files are a way to tell git what you want to
      ignore--that is, not commit to your repo and track changes against.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-do-i-need-this-tool-">Why do I need this tool?</h3>
    <p>
      Kind people on the internet have written <code>.gitignore</code> files for
      several languages, operating systems, editors, etc. already. GitHub will
      even let you choose one when you create a new repository!However,
      sometimes you need to combine multiple files together to cover all the
      things you want to exclude.

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>
      These instructions are written for <code>bash</code>. This has been tested
      on Ubuntu and OSX.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># Download to usr/local/bin so you can access it from anywhere</span>
sudo wget -O <span class="hljs-regexp">/usr/</span>local<span class="hljs-regexp">/bin/m</span>ega-gitignore https:<span class="hljs-regexp">//</span>raw.githubusercontent.com<span class="hljs-regexp">/samruddhisomani/m</span>ega-gitignore<span class="hljs-regexp">/master/m</span>ega-gitignore

<span class="hljs-comment"># Give the script execute permissions so you can actually run it</span>
sudo chmod +x <span class="hljs-regexp">/usr/</span>local<span class="hljs-regexp">/bin/m</span>ega-gitignore
</code></pre>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>
      From inside the directory you need the <code>.gitignore</code> for run
      <code>mega-gitignore</code> with all the gitignore boilerplates you want
      separated by spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a <code>.gitignore</code> file doesn&#39;t exist, this command will add
      one and fill it out as requested. If one already exists, this will append
      the requested boilerplates to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All gitignore boilerplates are sourced from
      <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">this repo</a>. Names are
      case sensitive and must match exactly with the part before
      <code>.gitignore</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Node and Python:</strong> This might be useful for a project where
      you have a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash">mega-gitignore <span class="hljs-keyword">Node</span> <span class="hljs-title">Python</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>OSX and VSCODE:</strong> This might be useful if you&#39;re
      working with VS Code on an OSX device. *Note that because these live in
      the Global folder in the boilerplates repo, we have to put
      <code>Global/</code> before them. While you could choose to instead add
      these to your personal global or local <code>.gitignore</code>, that
      option runs the risk of collaborators adding those files in by mistake.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"><span class="hljs-symbol">mega</span>-gitignore <span class="hljs-meta">Global</span>/macOS <span class="hljs-meta">Global</span>/VisualStudioCode
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Jupyter Notebooks and Python:</strong> This might be useful for a
      project where you&#39;re using Jupyter notebooks but you still want to
      make sure you don&#39;t accidentally include common Python exclusions.
