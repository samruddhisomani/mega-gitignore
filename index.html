      Combine a series of .gitignores into one mega file. Perfect for those of
      us who want to use multiple gitignores in one project.

      Why do we even care about <code>.gitignore</code> files?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes (most of the time?) you don&#39;t want to commit every single
      file in your directory. Common files to exclude include build artifacts
      and log files. These files are a way to tell git what you want to
      ignore--that is, not commit to your repo and track changes against.
    </p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-need-this-tool-">Why do I need this tool?</h4>
    <p>
      Kind people on the internet have written <code>.gitignore</code> files for
      several languages, operating systems, editors, etc. already. GitHub will
      even let you choose one when you create a new repository! However,
      sometimes you need to combine multiple files together to cover all the
      things you want to exclude. This tool automates this collation process
      so you can spend less time setting up your environment and more time building cool things!</strong

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>
      These instructions are written for <code>bash</code>. This has been tested
      on Ubuntu and OSX.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash"># Download to usr/local/bin so you can access it from anywhere</span>
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/mega-gitignore \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samruddhisomani/mega-gitignore/main/mega-gitignore

# Give the script execute permissions so you can actually run it
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mega-gitignore
</code></pre>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>
      From inside the directory you need the <code>.gitignore</code> for run
      <code>mega-gitignore</code> with all the gitignore boilerplates you want
      separated by spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a <code>.gitignore</code> file doesn&#39;t exist, this command will add
      one and fill it out as requested. If one already exists, this will append
      the requested boilerplates to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All gitignore boilerplates are sourced from
      <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">this repo</a>. Names are
      case sensitive and must match exactly with the part before
      <code>.gitignore</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Node and Python:</strong> This might be useful for a project where
      you have a Python backend and a JavaScript frontend.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash">mega-gitignore Node Python
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>OSX and VSCODE:</strong> This might be useful if you&#39;re
      working with VS Code on an OSX device. *Note that because these live in
      the Global folder in the boilerplates repo, we have to put
      <code>Global/</code> before them. While you could choose to instead add
      these to your personal global or local <code>.gitignore</code>, that
      option runs the risk of collaborators adding those files in by mistake.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-bash">mega-gitignore Global/macOS Global/VisualStudioCode
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Jupyter Notebooks and Python:</strong> This might be useful for a
      project where you&#39;re using Jupyter notebooks but you still want to
      make sure you don&#39;t accidentally include common Python exclusions.
